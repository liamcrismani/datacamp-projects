# Creating Functions to Register App Users  
  
Adapted/extended from DataCamp Projects. Original project submission [here](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2216).  

This was originally two seperate DataCamp projects; [Creating Functions to Register App Users](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2216) and [Buliding Core Sign-Up Functions to Help Validate New Users](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2198). Since the code written in the latter is provided for you in the former, I have joined to two repos, so the code is all written by me.  
  
## Repo contents  
- `notebook.ipynb` - original submission  
- `python_functions.py` - functions for validating user details (name, email address, password). This is the python file that comes with the project - but here we will use `validation_functions.py` from [/sign-up-functions], as those are written by me. 
- `script.py` - functions for validating and registering the user  
- `test_script.py` - test functions
