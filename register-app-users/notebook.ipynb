Your managers have asked you to develop a new account registration system for a mobile app. The system must validate user input on the sign-up form before creating an account. \n","\n","The previous junior developer wrote some helper functions that validate the name, email, and password. Use these functions to register users, store their data, and implement some error handling! These have been imported into the workspace for you. They will be a great help to you when registering the user, but first you have to understand what the function does! Inspect the docstrings of each of the helper functions: `validate_name`, `validate_email` and `validate_password`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"id":"41cba5d8-fa60-482f-ad0a-8c86bbd84a8a","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":47,"lastExecutedAt":1719757092818,"lastExecutedByKernel":"9ecdd262-7f51-402f-bf3b-35817ee9300b","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"def validate_user(name: str, email: str, password: str) -> None:\n    if validate_name(name):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Name must be greater than two characters and contain letters only.\")\n    if validate_email(email):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid email format.\")\n    if validate_password(password):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid password format.\")\n    return True\n\ndef register_user(name: str, email: str, password: str) -> None:\n    if validate_user(name, email, password):\n        user = {'name': name, 'email': email, 'password': password}\n        return user \n    else:\n        return False\n"},"outputs":[],"source":["from signupfunctions.validation_functions import validate_name, validate_email, top_level_domains\n","from python_functions import validate_password\n","\n","\n","def validate_user(name: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool | None:\n","    \"\"\" Checks users inputs are of correct types.\n","\n","    Args:\n","      name: str: User name\n","      email: str: User email address.
