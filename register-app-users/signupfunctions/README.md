# Building Core Sign Up Functions to Help Validate New Users  

Adapted from [this DataCamp project](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/2198)
  
The functions in `validation_functions.py` are similar to those in the DataCamp project [Creating Functions to Register App Users](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2216). In that project the functions are written for the user in the file `python_functions.py`. I have adapted my version of that project to use the functions I have written here, instead of the pre-written ones. You can see that repo [in the 'register-app-users' folder](/register-app-users). 

## Repo contents  
- `validation_functions.py` - file with functions to validate name and email user input.  
- `test_validation_functions.py` - test functions.  
- `notebook.ipynb'` - original submission on DataCamp.
