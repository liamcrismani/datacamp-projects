- [ ] Define a function called format_date(), which formats a timestamp into a readable datetime string.

    It must accept two parameters: timestamp - the Unix timestamp integer, and datetime_format - a string specifying the desired date format.
    The function should return the date correctly formatted as a string.
    For example, calling format_date(1514665153, "%d-%m-%Y") should output "30-12-2017".

- [ ] Define a function called calculate_landing_time(), which calculates the estimated landing time.

    It must accept two parameters: rocket_launch_dt - the rocket launch datetime object, and travel_duration - the expected travel time in days as an integer.
    The function should return the estimated Mars landing time as a datetime string in the format DD-MM-YYYY.
    For example, calling calculate_landing_time(datetime(2023, 2, 15), 20) should output "07-03-2023".

- [ ] Define a function named days_until_delivery(), which calculates the days until a package arrives for customers.

    It must accept two parameters: expected_delivery_dt - the estimated delivery date as a datetime object for the package, and current_dt - the current date as a datetime object.
    The function should calculate the difference in days between the expected delivery datetime and the current datetime, then return the number of days remaining as an integer.
    For example, calling days_until_delivery(datetime(2023, 2, 15), datetime(2023, 2, 5)) should output 10.
