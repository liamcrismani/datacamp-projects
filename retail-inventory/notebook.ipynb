    "In this project, you will develop a comprehensive inventory management system for a retail business by applying your knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Imagine you are working for an e-commerce company called `ShopSmart`, a rapidly growing online retailer that sells a wide range of products, including electronics, clothing, and home goods. As the company expands, efficiently managing inventory becomes crucial to ensure smooth operations and customer satisfaction.\n",

    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic. OOP allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code, which is particularly beneficial for complex systems like inventory management systems."

    "    - Define a `new_product` variable that will call the constructor of the Product class.\n",
